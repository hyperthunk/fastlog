# Fast Erlang/OTP Logging Support

This small OTP application aims to bring together several utilities to provide the fastest and most efficient logging support for Erlang/OTP applications. This includes the formatting enhancements for SASL logging provided by [riak_err](https://github.com/basho/riak_err), and support for *disk_log* based logging plus a few other things.

## Status and Version Management
